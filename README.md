<p><b>CerberusRAT</b></p>

 - CerberusRAT is a cross-platform and open source remote administration tool
 - All you need is to launch builder.py with python3 and select options
 - Then you will get an attacker and a victim files.
 - Victim file connects client to a computer where Attacker is launched.
 - All transfering data(files, screenshots, webcam, commands, logs) is secured with end-to-end RSA encryption.
 - All commands are included in attacker client. Just enter "help" when client is connected.


<p><b>Usage: python3 builder.py -s (Host IP) -p (Host Port, you choose it when launch attacker script) -f (filename).py</b></p>

After that, you will get a .py file and an executable file(executables on Windows and Linux are not the same). Executable will be in "dist" folder.


P.S. Sorry for bad readme, I will fix it later.
